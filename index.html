<!-- ~~~~~~~~~
My notes are going to be like this for mostly anything, I'll use the 
* for extra mile things and the 
== for dope things I see 
~~~~~~~~~ -->



<!-- ~~~~~~~~~
So structural HTML at the Top level includes just this:
<html>
  <head>
  <body>
</html>

So your <main> right here doesn't make much sense and because of it
if you inspect this page in your browser, it looks awkward, but it works because Chrome
can smart detect where specific elements and tags are supposed to go
~~~~~~~~~ -->
<main role="main"></main>

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
  <title>Horiseon Website</title>
</head>

<body>
  <header role="banner">

    <!-- ~~~~~~~~~
    I don't know what this <div> is supposed to contain for its children
    ~~~~~~~~~ -->
    <div role="navigation" aria-label="main">

      <!-- ~~~~~~~~~
      I see that you were headed towards <nav> and this is where it most likely
      would be put and the header class you have here would be put with your <header>

      <div class="header">

  For more Semantic tags I would use these ones in the structural correct spots
  in place of these <div>:

  <section>
  <main>
  <aside>
  <article>

  <div class="hero"></div>

        <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        <p>
          The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel,
          shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility
          and find the right customers for your business.

      <div id="online-reputation-management" class="online-reputation-management">
        <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" alt="Image Person working on a computer"
          class="float-right" />
        <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
        <p>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet
          connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control
          over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

          class="float-left" />
        <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
          determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase
          your lead generation.

        <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Image arrow to dollar sign" />
        <p>
          Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to
          your website.

        <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
        <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Image of lightbulb" />
        <p>
          Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for
          your business.

        <p>
          As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to
          advertise your page.
